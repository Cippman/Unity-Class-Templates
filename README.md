# Unity-Class-Templates
Are you bored of that default class everytime you click ''create new behaviour script"?

# Raw but true!
With this you'll be allowed to right click and create some default class templates in addition to default behaviour script

# Actually WIP and sorry for missing documentation.
Just discover it by yourself if you're interested.
